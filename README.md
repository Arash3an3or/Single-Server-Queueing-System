# Single-Server-Queueing-System
### Queueing Theory Task

The main task of these experiments
is to provide an experimental proof of the Central
Limit Theorem. These models and experiments with
such models also enhance the learner’s understanding
of pseudo- and quasi-random number generators and
the exponential distribution. That could provide basic
ideas for more advanced experiments with the model
of queueing systems.

For example random.randint(a, b) returns a random integer N
such that a <= N <= b and random.expovariate(lambd)
returns exponentially distributed random numbers with
the parameter ‘lambd’

### Queueing systems

![Alt text](images/The_simple_queueing_sys.png?raw=true "Queueing system")

An overall
queueing system could be characterized by three main
components: the arrival process, the service mechanism and the queue discipline. Arrivals may come from
one or several limited or unlimited sources.
The arrival process describes how customers arrive
to the system. We denote by αi the interarrival time
between the arrivals of the (i−1) and ith customer, the
expected inter-arrival time (or mean) by E(α) and the
arrival frequency by λ = 1 / E(α).
